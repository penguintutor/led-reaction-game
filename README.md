# Raspberry Pi Pico LED Reaction Game
Hardware game based around the Raspberry Pi Pico, NeoPixels and a very big button.

The program file is called code.py and needs to be installed to the Raspberry Pi Pico along with libraries for the NeoPixel strip and the I2C LCD display.

## Enclosure

I have designed an enclosure in FreeCAD. See the enclosure directory for the FreeCAD files.
